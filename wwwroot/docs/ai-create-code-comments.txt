````csharp
/*
    DateGreaterThanValidation Custom Validation Attribute
    
    Purpose: Provides custom validation logic to ensure event dates are not set in the past,
    enforcing business rules for event scheduling in the EventEase application.
    
    Validation Rules:
    - New events: Date must be today or in the future
    - Existing events: Date validation is bypassed (allows editing of past events)
    - Empty/null dates: Validation passes (handled by Required attribute separately)
    - Invalid date formats: Returns descriptive error message
    
    Business Logic:
    - Prevents creation of events with past dates
    - Allows editing of existing events regardless of date (preserves historical data)
    - Uses DateTime.Today as the minimum acceptable date for new events
    - Provides user-friendly error messages for validation failures
    
    Implementation Details:
    - Inherits from ValidationAttribute for integration with DataAnnotations
    - Uses ValidationContext to access the Event object being validated
    - Checks Event.Id to distinguish between new (Guid.Empty) and existing events
    - Handles string-to-DateTime conversion with error handling
    
    Usage: Applied as a data annotation to Event.Date property to enforce date constraints
    during form validation in event creation and editing scenarios.

````csharp
/*
    Event Model Class
    
    Purpose: Represents an event entity in the EventEase application with comprehensive data validation 
    and business rules for event management and scheduling.
    
    Properties:
    - Id: Unique identifier for the event (Guid)
    - Name: Event title with required validation and 100-character limit
    - Date: Event date with required validation and custom date constraint
    - Location: Event venue with required validation and 200-character limit
    - Notes: Optional additional information with 500-character limit
    
    Validation Rules:
    - Name: Required field with descriptive error message and length constraint
    - Date: Required, must be today or future date for new events (DateGreaterThanValidation)
    - Location: Required field with descriptive error message and length constraint
    - Notes: Optional field with maximum length constraint for data integrity
    
    Business Logic:
    - Default date set to today for new event creation
    - Custom validation prevents scheduling events in the past
    - String length limits ensure database compatibility and UI consistency
    - Empty string defaults prevent null reference issues
    
    Data Annotations:
    - Required: Enforces mandatory field validation
    - StringLength: Prevents data truncation and ensures consistent UI display
    - DataType.Date: Provides proper date picker rendering in forms

    EventStatistics Model Class
    
    Purpose: Provides statistical data and calculations for event attendance and registration metrics

    Properties:
    - RegistrationCount: Total number of people registered for an event
    - AttendeeCount: Number of registered people who actually attended the event
    - AttendanceRate: Calculated percentage of registrants who attended (read-only)
    
    Calculations:
    - AttendanceRate: Automatically calculated as (AttendeeCount / RegistrationCount) * 100
    - Division by zero protection: Returns 0% when no registrations exist
    - Percentage format: Returns decimal value that can be formatted as percentage in UI
    
    Business Logic:
    - Tracks event participation effectiveness through attendance rates
    - Provides insights for event planning and capacity management
    - Supports reporting and analytics features
    - Helps identify popular events and attendance patterns
    
    Usage: Used in event cards, details views, and reporting components to display
    registration and attendance metrics. Calculated values update automatically
    when RegistrationCount or AttendeeCount properties change.

/*
    IEventService Interface
    
    Purpose: Defines the contract for event data management operations in the EventEase application,
    providing a standardized interface for event CRUD operations and data retrieval.
    
    Core Operations:
    - GetAllAsync: Retrieves all events from the data store
    - GetByIdAsync: Fetches a specific event by its unique identifier
    - AddAsync: Creates a new event and returns the created entity
    - UpdateAsync: Modifies an existing event and returns the updated entity
    - DeleteAsync: Removes an event from the data store by ID
    
    Advanced Operations:
    - GetPagedAsync: Retrieves events with pagination support and cancellation
    - TryGetByIdAsync: Safe event retrieval that returns null if not found
    - ExistsAsync: Checks if an event exists without retrieving the full entity
    
    Design Patterns:
    - Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access logic from business logic
    - Async/Await: All operations are asynchronous for optimal performance
    - Cancellation Support: Long-running operations support cancellation tokens
    - Null Safety: Provides safe methods that handle missing entities gracefully
    
    Error Handling:
    - GetByIdAsync: May throw exceptions for invalid IDs or missing entities
    - TryGetByIdAsync: Returns null instead of throwing for missing entities
    - Validation: Implementations should validate input parameters
    
    Usage: Implemented by concrete service classes and injected into components
    for event management operations throughout the EventEase application.

    - Reduces redundant database queries and improves UI responsiveness

/*
    IRegistrationService Interface
    
    Purpose: Defines the contract for registration data management operations in the EventEase application,
    providing a standardized interface for registration CRUD operations, event-specific queries, and attendance tracking.
    
    Core Operations:
    - GetAllAsync: Retrieves all registrations from the data store
    - GetByIdAsync: Fetches a specific registration by its unique identifier
    - AddAsync: Creates a new registration and returns the created entity
    - UpdateAsync: Modifies an existing registration and returns the updated entity
    - DeleteAsync: Removes a registration from the data store by ID
    
    Event-Specific Operations:
    - GetAllForEventAsync: Retrieves all registrations for a specific event
    - GetPagedForEventAsync: Paginated registrations for a specific event with cancellation
    - GetRegistrationCountForEventAsync: Gets total registration count for an event
    - GetAttendedRegistrationsForEventAsync: Retrieves only attended registrations for an event
    - IsUserRegisteredForEventAsync: Checks if a user is already registered for an event
    
    Advanced Operations:
    - GetPagedAsync: Retrieves registrations with pagination support and cancellation
    - TryGetByIdAsync: Safe registration retrieval that returns null if not found
    - ExistsAsync: Checks if a registration exists without retrieving the full entity
    
    Design Patterns:
    - Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access logic from business logic
    - Async/Await: All operations are asynchronous for optimal performance
    - Cancellation Support: Long-running operations support cancellation tokens
    - Null Safety: Provides safe methods that handle missing entities gracefully
    
    Error Handling:
    - GetByIdAsync: May throw exceptions for invalid IDs or missing entities
    - TryGetByIdAsync: Returns null instead of throwing for missing entities
    - Validation: Implementations should validate input parameters and business rules
    
    Usage: Implemented by concrete service classes and injected into components
    for registration management, attendance tracking, and event participation operations
    throughout the EventEase application.
