Conversation Title: Implement Mock Data/LocalStorage Service

Prompt:
Can you describe what this files does in the app?

Response:
This file defines a mock implementation of an event service for your Blazor application. The MockEventService class provides in-memory CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Event objects using a thread-safe dictionary. It implements the IEventService interface, allowing the rest of your app to interact with event data as if it were coming from a real database or API.

Key points:

Seed Data: The constructor seeds the service with two sample events.
GetAllAsync: Returns all events as a list.
GetByIdAsync: Returns a single event by its ID.
AddAsync: Adds a new event and assigns it a unique ID.
UpdateAsync: Updates an existing event if it exists.
DeleteAsync: Removes an event by its ID.
This service is useful for development and testing, letting you work with event data without needing a real backend.

Prompt:
What type of service would you recommend to replace it with persisted local storage in this app?

Response:
To replace MockEventService with a service that persists data in local storage, you should implement a new service that uses the browser's local storage API. In Blazor, this is commonly done using the ProtectedLocalStorage or LocalStorage (from the Blazored.LocalStorage NuGet package) for easier use.

Recommended approach:
Create a LocalStorageEventService that implements IEventService and uses local storage to save, retrieve, update, and delete events.

Key steps:

Install Blazored.LocalStorage
Run in terminal:
dotnet add package Blazored.LocalStorage

Implement the service:
Inject ILocalStorageService and use it to persist the event list as JSON.

Example skeleton:
using Blazored.LocalStorage;
using BlazorFinalProject.Models;
using BlazorFinalProject.Services.Interfaces;

public class LocalStorageEventService : IEventService
{
    private readonly ILocalStorageService _localStorage;
    private const string EventsKey = "events";

    public LocalStorageEventService(ILocalStorageService localStorage)
    {
        _localStorage = localStorage;
    }

    public async Task<List<Event>> GetAllAsync()
    {
        var events = await _localStorage.GetItemAsync<List<Event>>(EventsKey);
        return events ?? new List<Event>();
    }

    public async Task<Event> GetByIdAsync(int id)
    {
        var events = await GetAllAsync();
        return events.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == id);
    }

    public async Task AddAsync(Event evt)
    {
        var events = await GetAllAsync();
        evt.Id = events.Any() ? events.Max(e => e.Id) + 1 : 1;
        events.Add(evt);
        await _localStorage.SetItemAsync(EventsKey, events);
    }

    public async Task UpdateAsync(Event evt)
    {
        var events = await GetAllAsync();
        var index = events.FindIndex(e => e.Id == evt.Id);
        if (index >= 0)
        {
            events[index] = evt;
            await _localStorage.SetItemAsync(EventsKey, events);
        }
    }

    public async Task DeleteAsync(int id)
    {
        var events = await GetAllAsync();
        events.RemoveAll(e => e.Id == id);
        await _localStorage.SetItemAsync(EventsKey, events);
    }
}

Summary:
This approach will persist events in the user's browser, surviving page reloads and browser restarts, but is still client-side only. For multi-user or server-side persistence, consider a database-backed API.

Prompt:
Should this service be registered as a Singleton, Scoped, or Transient?

Response:
For a Blazor WebAssembly app using LocalStorageEventService, you should register it as Scoped:
builder.Services.AddScoped<IEventService, LocalStorageEventService>();

Reason:

In Blazor WebAssembly, services that interact with browser APIs (like local storage) or depend on per-user state should be registered as Scoped.
Scoped services are created once per browser session, which matches the lifecycle of most Blazor WebAssembly apps.
Singleton is not recommended for services that use JS interop or browser APIs, as it can cause issues with state and JS runtime access.
Remove the AddSingleton<IEventService, MockEventService>() line to avoid conflicts.

Prompt:
I have the service added and configured. I was able to create an event record, but the record did not survive closing and reopening the browser. Did I miss a step?

Response:
If your event record did not persist after closing and reopening the browser, here are the most common causes and steps to check:

Are you calling SetItemAsync after every add/update/delete?
Make sure your LocalStorageEventService saves the updated event list to local storage after every change. If you followed the earlier example, this should be correct.

Are you using the correct key consistently?
The key (e.g., "events") used in GetItemAsync and SetItemAsync must be the same everywhere.

Are you running in a private/incognito window?
Some browsers clear local storage when the session ends in private/incognito mode.

Is your browser blocking local storage?
Check browser settings or extensions that might block or clear local storage.

Are you resetting or seeding data on every app start?
If your service or app seeds demo data on every load (like the mock service), it might overwrite what's in local storage. Make sure your LocalStorageEventService does not seed or overwrite data on startup.

Summary:

Double-check that your LocalStorageEventService only reads from local storage on startup and does not overwrite it.
Ensure you are not running in incognito/private mode.
Make sure you are not clearing local storage elsewhere in your app.
If you want, you can share your LocalStorageEventService code for a more specific review.

To check if Firefox is blocking local storage:

Check Site Permissions:

Click the padlock icon in the address bar.
Click "Clear Cookies and Site Data" or "Connection secure" > "More Information".
Under Permissions, ensure "Store data in persistent storage" is Allowed.
Check Privacy Settings:

Go to Settings > Privacy & Security.
Under Cookies and Site Data, make sure "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed" is not enabled (or add your site as an exception).
Under Enhanced Tracking Protection, if set to Strict, try switching to Standard.
Check for Private Browsing:

Local storage is cleared when you close a private window. Make sure you are not in private browsing mode.
Check for Extensions:

Some privacy extensions can block or clear local storage. Try disabling extensions to test.
Test Local Storage:

Open the Developer Tools (F12), go to the Storage tab, and expand Local Storage for your site. Try adding an item in the console:
If you see 123, local storage is working.
If local storage is blocked or cleared, adjust your settings as above.

Prompt:
Can you now please create a LocalStorageRegistrationService that implements IRegistrationService and uses local storage to save, retrieve, update, and delete events.

Response:
using Blazored.LocalStorage;
using BlazorFinalProject.Models;
using BlazorFinalProject.Services.Interfaces;

public class LocalStorageRegistrationService : IRegistrationService
{
    private readonly ILocalStorageService _localStorage;
    private const string RegistrationsKey = "registrations";

    public LocalStorageRegistrationService(ILocalStorageService localStorage)
    {
        _localStorage = localStorage;
    }

    public async Task<List<Registration>> GetAllForEventAsync(int eventId)
    {
        var regs = await _localStorage.GetItemAsync<List<Registration>>(RegistrationsKey);
        return (regs ?? new List<Registration>()).Where(r => r.EventId == eventId).ToList();
    }

    public async Task<Registration> GetByIdAsync(int id)
    {
        var regs = await _localStorage.GetItemAsync<List<Registration>>(RegistrationsKey);
        return (regs ?? new List<Registration>()).FirstOrDefault(r => r.Id == id);
    }

    public async Task AddAsync(Registration reg)
    {
        var regs = await _localStorage.GetItemAsync<List<Registration>>(RegistrationsKey) ?? new List<Registration>();
        reg.Id = regs.Any() ? regs.Max(r => r.Id) + 1 : 1;
        regs.Add(reg);
        await _localStorage.SetItemAsync(RegistrationsKey, regs);
    }

    public async Task UpdateAsync(Registration reg)
    {
        var regs = await _localStorage.GetItemAsync<List<Registration>>(RegistrationsKey) ?? new List<Registration>();
        var index = regs.FindIndex(r => r.Id == reg.Id);
        if (index >= 0)
        {
            regs[index] = reg;
            await _localStorage.SetItemAsync(RegistrationsKey, regs);
        }
    }

    public async Task DeleteAsync(int id)
    {
        var regs = await _localStorage.GetItemAsync<List<Registration>>(RegistrationsKey) ?? new List<Registration>();
        regs.RemoveAll(r => r.Id == id);
        await _localStorage.SetItemAsync(RegistrationsKey, regs);

}

Prompt:
The event details cards in multiple rows are covering the Edit and Delete buttons in the next higher row. How can I adjust the style settings to fix this; a margin od 2 seems like it mioght be a good fit.

Response:
You can fix the overlap by adding a bottom margin to each event card column. Since you’re using Bootstrap, you can add the mb-2 (margin-bottom: 0.5rem) or mb-3 (margin-bottom: 1rem) class to the .col div that wraps each card.

Change this:
<div class="col">
    <EventCard Event="evt" DetailsPageUri="/events/details" />
    <div class="mt-2">
        <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary me-2" @onclick="@(() => EditEvent(evt))">Edit</button>
        <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger" @onclick="@(() => ConfirmDelete(evt))">Delete</button>
    </div>
</div>

To this:
<div class="col mb-2">
    <EventCard Event="evt" DetailsPageUri="/events/details" />
    <div class="mt-2">
        <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary me-2" @onclick="@(() => EditEvent(evt))">Edit</button>
        <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger" @onclick="@(() => ConfirmDelete(evt))">Delete</button>
    </div>
</div>

You can use mb-2 or increase to mb-3 for more space. This will prevent the cards and their buttons from overlapping the next row.

Prompt:
How do I set today's date as the default date in the InputDate control?

Response:
To set today’s date as the default in the InputDate control, you should initialize the Event.Date property to DateTime.Today when creating a new event. This is typically done in the parent component (e.g., when you create a new Event in your EventsPage.razor).

Example for your AddNewEvent method:
private void AddNewEvent()
{
    selectedEvent = new Event
    {
        Date = DateTime.Today // Set default date to today
    };
    showForm = true;
}

This way, when the form is shown, the InputDate will display today’s date by default. No changes are needed in the EventForm.razor itself.

Prompt:
How can I create a placeholder for the InputText field 'Event.Name"?

Response:
You can add a placeholder to the InputText field by using the placeholder attribute directly in the component markup. Here’s how you can do it for the Event.Name field:
<InputText id="name" class="form-control" @bind-Value="Event.Name" placeholder="Enter event name" />

This will display "Enter event name" as a placeholder in the input box until the user types something.
