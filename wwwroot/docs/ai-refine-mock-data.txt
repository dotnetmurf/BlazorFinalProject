Conversation Title: Refine the Mock Data Service

Prompt:
I am going to send you some code samples to illustrate what I am going to ask you to create for me.

Response:
Understood! Please go ahead and send your code samples or requirements. I’m ready to help you create what you need.

Prompt:
    public MockEventService()
    {
        // Seed data
        var initialEvents = new[]
        {
            new Event { Id = 1, Name = "Developer Summit", Date = DateTime.Today.AddDays(5), Location = "Chicago", Notes = "Tech insights from top minds." },
            new Event { Id = 2, Name = "UX Workshop", Date = DateTime.Today.AddDays(12), Location = "Remote", Notes = "Hands-on UI prototyping." }
        };

        foreach (var evt in initialEvents)
        {
            evt.Id = ++_currentId;
            _events[evt.Id] = evt;
        }
    }


Response:
Certainly! The code you provided is a constructor for a mock service that seeds initial data for events. If you want to create a similar constructor for a MockRegistrationService that seeds initial registration data, here’s how you can do it:

public MockRegistrationService()
{
    // Seed data
    var initialRegistrations = new[]
    {
        new Registration { Id = 1, EventId = 1, UserName = "Alice Smith", Telephone = "13129857612", EmailAddress = "alice@example.com", Notes = "new note 1" },
        new Registration { Id = 2, EventId = 1, UserName = "John Jones", Telephone = "13129858592", EmailAddress = "john@example.com", Notes = "new note 2" },
        new Registration { Id = 3, EventId = 2, UserName = "Mike Parry", Telephone = "17082748726", EmailAddress = "mikee@example.com", Notes = "new note 3" },
        new Registration { Id = 4, EventId = 2, UserName = "Lisa Wilson", Telephone = "12248450087", EmailAddress = "lisa@example.com", Notes = "new note 4" }
    };

    foreach (var reg in initialRegistrations)
    {
        reg.Id = ++_currentId;
        _registrations[reg.Id] = reg;
    }
}

This will:

Seed your mock registration service with initial data for two events.
Ensure each registration gets a unique ID and is added to the in-memory dictionary.
You can adjust the sample data as needed for your scenario.

Prompt:
Yes, thank you for providing the code for a MockRegistrationService constructor . I want you to create a MockDataService.cs file. It will have separate methods for initialEvents and initialRegistrations data sets. For the first step, each method will delete all existing local data its related records of events and registrations. After each data set is created, it will save the data to the LocalStorage service. After the new data for events and registrations is saved, it will notify the parent EventsPage to refresh the list. The file will also have a method for calling the two seed data methods in order of events first and registrations second. I am eager to see what you create for me.

Response:
MockDataService.cs:

using Blazored.LocalStorage;
using BlazorFinalProject.Models;
using BlazorFinalProject.Services.Interfaces;

public class MockDataService
{
    private readonly ILocalStorageService _localStorage;
    private const string EventsKey = "events";
    private const string RegistrationsKey = "registrations";

    public MockDataService(ILocalStorageService localStorage)
    {
        _localStorage = localStorage;
    }

    // Deletes all events and seeds new event data
    public async Task SeedEventsAsync()
    {
        await _localStorage.RemoveItemAsync(EventsKey);

        var initialEvents = new List<Event>
        {
            new Event { Id = 1, Name = "Developer Summit", Date = DateTime.Today.AddDays(5), Location = "Chicago", Notes = "Tech insights from top minds." },
            new Event { Id = 2, Name = "UX Workshop", Date = DateTime.Today.AddDays(12), Location = "Remote", Notes = "Hands-on UI prototyping." }
        };

        await _localStorage.SetItemAsync(EventsKey, initialEvents);
    }

    // Deletes all registrations and seeds new registration data
    public async Task SeedRegistrationsAsync()
    {
        await _localStorage.RemoveItemAsync(RegistrationsKey);

        var initialRegistrations = new List<Registration>
        {
            new Registration { Id = 1, EventId = 1, UserName = "Alice Smith", Telephone = "13129857612", EmailAddress = "alice@example.com", Notes = "new note 1" },
            new Registration { Id = 2, EventId = 1, UserName = "John Jones", Telephone = "13129858592", EmailAddress = "john@example.com", Notes = "new note 2" },
            new Registration { Id = 3, EventId = 2, UserName = "Mike Parry", Telephone = "17082748726", EmailAddress = "mikee@example.com", Notes = "new note 3" },
            new Registration { Id = 4, EventId = 2, UserName = "Lisa Wilson", Telephone = "12248450087", EmailAddress = "lisa@example.com", Notes = "new note 4" }
        };

        await _localStorage.SetItemAsync(RegistrationsKey, initialRegistrations);
    }

    // Seeds both events and registrations, events first
    public async Task SeedAllAsync(Func<Task>? onSeedComplete = null)
    {
        await SeedEventsAsync();
        await SeedRegistrationsAsync();

        if (onSeedComplete is not null)
        {
            await onSeedComplete();
        }
    }
}

Usage notes:

Inject MockDataService and call SeedAllAsync from your parent (e.g., EventsPage.razor), passing a callback to refresh the lists.
The onSeedComplete parameter allows you to notify the parent to refresh after seeding.
You can expand this service with more seed data or logic as needed.

Prompt:
Inject MockDataService and call SeedAllAsync from your parent (e.g., EventsPage.razor), passing a callback to refresh the lists; can you please provide the code to do this?

Response:
Certainly! Here’s how you can inject MockDataService and add a button to seed the data and refresh your events list in EventsPage.razor:

1. Inject the service at the top:
@inject MockDataService MockDataService

2. Add a button to trigger seeding (place this above or below your "Add New Event" button):
<button class="btn btn-warning mb-3 ms-2" @onclick="SeedMockDataAsync">Seed Mock Data</button>

3. Add the method in your @code block:
private async Task SeedMockDataAsync()
{
    await MockDataService.SeedAllAsync(async () =>
    {
        events = await EventService.GetAllAsync();
        StateHasChanged();
    });
}

Full Example Snippet:
@inject MockDataService MockDataService

...

<button class="btn btn-primary mb-3" @onclick="AddNewEvent">Add New Event</button>
<button class="btn btn-warning mb-3 ms-2" @onclick="SeedMockDataAsync">Seed Mock Data</button>

...

@code {
    // ...existing code...

    private async Task SeedMockDataAsync()
    {
        await MockDataService.SeedAllAsync(async () =>
        {
            events = await EventService.GetAllAsync();
            StateHasChanged();
        });
    }
}

This will:

Inject your MockDataService
Add a button to seed mock data
Refresh the events list after seeding
If you want to refresh registrations as well, add similar logic for your registrations list.

Prompt:
Can you please create an IMockDataService.cs interface file?

Response:
IMockDataService.cs:
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace BlazorFinalProject.Services.Interfaces
{
    public interface IMockDataService
    {
        Task SeedEventsAsync();
        Task SeedRegistrationsAsync();
        Task SeedAllAsync(Func<Task>? onSeedComplete = null);
    }
}

Prompt:
'builder.Services.AddScoped<IMockDataService, MockDataService>();'; is AddScoped the proper registration for this service?

Response:
Yes, AddScoped<IMockDataService, MockDataService>() is the proper registration for this service in a Blazor WebAssembly app.

Reason:

Scoped services are created once per user session in Blazor WebAssembly, which is appropriate for services that interact with browser APIs (like local storage) and do not need to be singletons.
Singleton is not recommended for services using JS interop or browser APIs in Blazor WebAssembly.
Transient would create a new instance every time, which is unnecessary for this scenario.
Summary:
AddScoped is the correct and recommended choice for MockDataService in this context.

Prompt:
<ModalDialog @ref="confirmDialog" Title="Confirm Delete" OnConfirm="DeleteConfirmedAsync" OnCancel="ClearPendingDelete">
    Are you sure you want to delete this event?
</ModalDialog>

I want to use the same ModalDialog operation the confirm using the SeedMockDataAsync method when it is called by the 'Seed Mock Data' button click. Can you provide this code, please?

Response:
Certainly! You can reuse the same ModalDialog for confirming the "Seed Mock Data" operation by:

...
<button class="btn btn-primary mb-3" @onclick="AddNewEvent">Add New Event</button>
<button class="btn btn-warning mb-3 ms-2" @onclick="ConfirmSeedMockData">Seed Mock Data</button>
...
<ModalDialog @ref="confirmDialog" Title="Confirm"
             OnConfirm="OnDialogConfirm"
             OnCancel="ClearPendingDialog">
    @dialogMessage
</ModalDialog>

@code {
    private List<Event> events = new();
    private Event? selectedEvent;
    private bool showForm = false;
    private Event? eventToDelete;
    private ModalDialog? confirmDialog;

    // Add these:
    private string dialogMessage = "";
    private string? pendingAction = null;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        events = await EventService.GetAllAsync();
    }

    private void ConfirmDelete(Event evt)
    {
        eventToDelete = evt;
        dialogMessage = "Are you sure you want to delete this event?";
        pendingAction = "delete";
        confirmDialog?.Show();
    }

    private void ConfirmSeedMockData()
    {
        dialogMessage = "Are you sure you want to seed mock data? This will overwrite all current events and registrations.";
        pendingAction = "seed";
        confirmDialog?.Show();
    }

    private void ClearPendingDialog()
    {
        eventToDelete = null;
        pendingAction = null;
        confirmDialog?.Hide();
    }

    private async Task OnDialogConfirm()
    {
        if (pendingAction == "delete" && eventToDelete is not null)
        {
            await EventService.DeleteAsync(eventToDelete.Id);
            events = await EventService.GetAllAsync();
        }
        else if (pendingAction == "seed")
        {
            await MockDataService.SeedAllAsync(async () =>
            {
                events = await EventService.GetAllAsync();
                StateHasChanged();
            });
        }
        ClearPendingDialog();
    }

    // ...rest of your code (AddNewEvent, EditEvent, SaveEventAsync, etc.)...
}

Adding a new state variable to track the type of confirmation (delete or seed).
Updating the dialog message and confirm action based on the operation.
Modifying your button and methods accordingly.
Here’s how you can do it:

How it works:

The ConfirmSeedMockData method sets the dialog message and action, then shows the modal.
The OnDialogConfirm method checks which action is pending and executes the appropriate logic.
The same modal is used for both delete and seed confirmations, with the message and action determined at runtime.

Prompt:
I am providing a copy of my existing EventsPage.razor file bellow. Can you please incorporate the necessary changes needed for adding the same ModalDialog operation the confirm using the SeedMockDataAsync method when it is called by the 'Seed Mock Data' button click in this file's code?

            });
        }
        ClearPendingDialog();
    }
}

Key changes:

The "Seed Mock Data" button now calls ConfirmSeedMockData instead of SeedMockDataAsync.
The ModalDialog is reused for both delete and seed confirmations, with a dynamic message and action.
The code tracks which action is pending and executes the correct logic in OnDialogConfirm.

Prompt:
Below are the two event records created by the SeedEventsAsync method; can you please create eight more events with random data (Id = 3 through Id = 8)?
