### Activity 3: Advanced Features & Production Readiness
**Objective**: Expand the application with advanced features and prepare for deployment

**Advanced Features Implemented**:
- ✅ **Registration Form** with comprehensive data validation (name, email, phone)
- ✅ **State Management** for user session tracking
- ✅ **Attendance Tracker** for event participation monitoring
- ✅ **Production Optimization** with best practices and dependency cleanup

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend Framework**: Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 9.0)
- **Development Tool**: Microsoft Copilot (Primary code generation and assistance)
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3 with responsive design
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code with C# Dev Kit

### Key Components Developed
1. **Event Card Component** - Displays event information with data binding
2. **Registration Form** - User input with validation and error handling
3. **Routing System** - Navigation between application pages
4. **State Management Service** - Session and data persistence
5. **Attendance Tracking** - Participation monitoring system
